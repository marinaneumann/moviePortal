Movie Portal Project 
By Marina Neumann 
2021 

Goals: 
A database of movies to track progress on movie bucket list. 

Use a database to store records. 
Use a movie API to have access to more data. 
Have good infrastructure for portal to expand or shrink. 
Have a front-end user-friendly interface. 
Be able to find all available sources to watch a specific movie (ie. Amazon, owned Dvd, netflix, etc)



Use Cases: 

1)To be able to search for all old movies to watch on your list (ie. movies before 1980). 

2)Randomly select movie based on potential search criteria (ie. I want to watch a comedy movie tonight or a movie with Christopher Plummer). 


Phases:
1) Build Movie class and Portal infrastructure. Establish basic add/display/search/remove functionality.
